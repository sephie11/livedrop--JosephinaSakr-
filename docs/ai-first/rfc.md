## AI Touchpoints

As part of the AI-first approach, I identified two near-term touchpoints that improve customer experience while keeping integration risk low:

- **Support Assistant** → answers FAQs and order-status queries automatically, with safe fallback to human support.  
- **Multi-lingual Search** → allows customers to search in Arabic, French, or other languages, improving product discovery and conversion.
